# Improved Swedish Keyboard Layout for OS X

## About

This is my personal keyboard layout modified from 'Swedish Pro' using Ukelele. The main goal is to fix my annoyances with the standard layout, mostly making it more like standard Windows/Linux layouts which I find better for programming.

## Installation

Place files in

	/Library/Keyboard Layouts (All users)
	~/Library/Keyboard Layouts (Only current user)
	
and restart. You can then choose the 'Swedish - SFZ' layout from System Preferences.

## Changes

### {, } on 7 and 0.

Simply the standard behaviour on Windows and Linux.

### \ on + and | on <

Like above simply the standard behaviour on Windows and Linux.

### ≤, <, >, ≥ on 7, 8, 9, 0

Shift + Option + 7,8,9,0 writes ≤, <, >, ≥ respectively. This change is mostly because ≤ is no longer reachable on the < key. It also hinders you from trying to access {, } the normal OS X way, which in my case is a feature.

### ≈, ≠ on 6

These keys could no longer be reached so I placed them on 6. It previously only duplicated symbols from the § key.

### (Incomplete) Exponents on ^ + key

For example, pressing ^ and then 2 writes ². The reason this is incomplete is because I couldn't find superscript unicode codes for all characters. If you can find a complete list I would really appreciate if you sent it to me, or even better, add them to layout and make a pull request. :)
